<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/a.png" width="60" height="62" alt="A" /></span>S
a picture of the manners and customs of the
Vagabond population of Central Europe before
the Reformation, I think this little book, the
earliest of its kind, will be found interesting. The fact of
Luther writing a Preface and editing it gives it at once
some degree of importance, and excites the curiosity of the
student.</p>

<p>In this country the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i> is almost unknown,
and in Germany only a few scholars and antiquaries
are acquainted with the book.</p>

<p>In translating it I have endeavoured as much as possible
to preserve the spirit and peculiarities of the original.
Some may object to the style as being too antique; but
this garb I thought preserved a small portion of the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">Pg vi</a></span>
quaintness, and was best suited to the period when it was
written.</p>

<p>For several explanations of old German words, and
other hints, I am indebted to a long notice of the <i>Liber
Vagatorum</i>, which occurs in the “Wiemarisches Jahrbuch,”
10<sup>te</sup>, Band, 1856,—the only article of any moment
that I know to have been written on the little book.</p>

<p>With respect to the facsimile woodcut, as it was too
large to occupy a place on the title, as in the original (of
4to. size), it is here given as a frontispiece.</p>

<p>Perhaps some apology is required for the occasional use
of plain-spoken, not to say coarse words. I can only urge,
in justification of their adoption, that the nature of the
subject would not admit of their being softened,—unless
indeed at the expense of the narrative. As it is, I have
sent forth this edition in very much more refined language
than the great Reformer thought necessary when issuing
the old German version.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/v.png" width="60" height="62" alt="V" /></span>AGABONDS and Beggars are ancient
blots in the history of the world. Idleness,
I suppose, existed before civilization
began, but feigned distress must
certainly have been practised soon after.</p>

<p>In the records of the Middle Ages enactments
for the suppression and ordering of vagrancy continually
occur. In this country, as we shall see directly,
laws for its abolishment were passed at a very
early date.</p>

<p>The begging system of the Friars, perhaps more
than any other cause, contributed to swell the ranks
of vagabonds. These religious mendicants, who had
long been increasing in number and dissoluteness, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">Pg x</a></span>
to beggars sundry lessons in hypocrisy, and taught
them, in their tales of fictitious distress, how to blend
the troubles of the soul with the infirmities of the
body. Numerous systems of religious imposture
were soon contrived, and mendicants of a hundred
orders swarmed through the land. Things were at
their worst, or rather both friars and vagabonds
were in their palmiest days, towards the latter part
of the fifteenth century, just before the suppression
of the Religious Houses commenced, and immediately
before the first symptoms of the Reformation
showed themselves,—that great movement which
was so soon to sweep one of the two pests away for
ever.</p>

<p>In Schreiber’s account of the <i>Bettler-industrie</i>
(begging practices) of Germany in the year 1475, he
thus speaks of this golden age for mendicants.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> His
theory, as to the origin of the complicated system of
mendicity, is, perhaps, more fanciful than true, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">Pg xi</a></span>his account is nevertheless very interesting, and well
worth extracting from.</p>

<p>“The beggars of Germany rejoiced in their
Golden Age; it extended throughout nearly two
centuries, from the invasions of the Turks until after
the conclusion of the Swedish war (1450 to 1650).
During this long period it was frequently the case
that begging was practised less from necessity than
for pleasure;—indeed, it was pursued like a regular
calling. For poetry had estranged herself from the
Nobility; knights no longer went out on adventures
to seek giants and dragons, or to liberate the Holy
Tomb; she had likewise become more and more
alien to the Citizen, since he considered it unwise to
brood over verses and rhymes, when he was called
upon to calculate his profits in hard coin. Even the
‘Sons of the Muses,’ the Scholars, had become more
prosaic, since there was so much to learn and so
many universities to visit, and the masters could no
longer wander from one country to another with
thousands of pupils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">Pg xii</a></span></p>

<p>“Then poetry (as everything in human life
gradually descends) began to ally herself with beggars
and vagrants. That which formerly had been
misfortune and misery became soon a sort of free
art, which only retained the mask of misery in order
to pursue its course more safely and undisturbed.
Mendicity became a distinct institution, was divided
into various branches, and was provided with a
language of its own. Doubtless, besides the frequent
wars, it was the Gipsies—appearing in Germany,
at the beginning of the fifteenth century, in
larger swarms than ever—who contributed greatly
to this state of things. They formed entire tribes
of wanderers, as free as the birds in the air, now
dispersing themselves, now reuniting, resting whereever
forests or moors pleased, or stupidity and superstition
allured them, possessing nothing, but appropriating
to themselves the property of everybody,
by stratagem or rude force.</p>

<p>“In what manner and to what extent such beggary
had grown up and branched off towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">Pg xiii</a></span>
close of the fifteenth century, what artifices and
even what language these beggars used to employ,
is shown us in Johann Knebel’s Chronicles, the
MSS. of which are preserved in the Library of the
City and University of Bâle.”</p>

<p>These MSS. are very curious. They contain the
proceedings of the Trials at Basle,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> in Switzerland,
in 1475, when a great number of vagabonds, strollers,
blind men, and mendicants of all orders, were
arrested and examined. Johann Knebel was the
chaplain of the cathedral there, and wrote them
down at the time. From the reports of these trials
it is believed the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i> was compiled;
and it is also conjectured that, from the same rich
source, Sebastian Brant, who just at that period had
established himself at the University of Basle, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">Pg xiv</a></span>he remained until 1500, drew the vivid description
of beggars and begging, to be found in his <i>Ship of
Fools</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Knebel gives a long list of the different orders of
beggars, and the names they were known by amongst
themselves. This account is similar to, only not
so spirited as that given in the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i>.
The tricks and impostures are very nearly the same,
together with the cant terms for the various tribes
of mendicants. Knebel, speaking of the manner in
which the tricks of these rogues were first found
out, says:—“At those times a great number of
knaves went about the country begging and annoying
people. Of these several were caught, and
they told how they and their fellow-knaves were
known, and when and how they used to meet, what
they were called, and they told also several of their
cant words.”</p>

<h3><span class="h">LIBER VAGATORUM</span></h3>

<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/a.png" width="60" height="62" alt="T" /></span>HE <i>Liber Vagatorum</i>, or <i>The Book of Vagabonds</i>,
was probably written shortly after
1509, that year being mentioned in the
work; it is the earliest book on beggars and their
secret language of which we have any record,—preceding
by half a century any similar work issued in
this country.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of the author other than
that it was written by one who styled himself a
“Reverend Magister, nomine expertus in truffis,”—which
proficiency in roguery, as Luther remarks,
“the little book very well proves, even though he
had not given himself such a name.”</p>

<p>None of the early impressions bears a date, but the
first edition is known to have been printed at Augsburg,
about the year 1512-14, by Erhart Öglin, or
Ocellus.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> It is a small quarto, consisting of 12 leaves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">Pg xvi</a></span></p>
<p>The title:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/016.jpg" width="250" height="72" alt="Ornament" /></div>

<p class="chap">is printed in red. The title-page of this, as of most
of the early editions, is embellished with a woodcut,—a
facsimile of which is given in this translation.
The picture, representing a beggar and his family,
explains itself. At the foot of the title is printed,
in black:—<i>Getrucht zu Augspurg durch Erhart
Öglin</i>. The little book was frequently reprinted
without any other variations than printers’ blunders
(one edition having an error in the first word,
<i>Lieber Vagatorum</i>) until 1528, when Luther edited
an edition,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> supplying a preface, and correcting
some of the passages. In 1529 another edition, with
Luther’s preface, appeared at Wittemberg,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and
from this, comparing it occasionally with the first
<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">Pg xvii</a></span>edition by Ocellus, the present English version has
been made. Nearly all the editions contain the
same matter; nor do those issued under Luther’s
authority furnish us with additional information.
With regard to the Vocabulary, however, I have
made, in a few instances, slight variations, as given
in two editions of the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i>, preserved
in the Library at Munich. Wherever there was a
marked divergence in style I have adopted that as
my text which seemed to be the most characteristic
for the fifteenth and the commencement of the sixteenth
centuries, and which is mostly to be found in
the better class MSS. and works of that period.</p>

<p>I should state, however, before proceeding further,
that a metrical version of the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i>,
in 838 verses, appeared about 1517-18, written
by Pamphilus Gengenbach, including a vocabulary
of the beggars’ cant. Although Karl Gödecke,
in his work, <i>Ein Beitrag zur Deutschen
Literatur Geschichte der Reformations zeit</i> (Hannover,
Carl Rümpler, 1855), has stated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">Pg xviii</a></span>
Gengenbach’s poetical version preceded the smaller
prose account, it is impossible, upon examining the
two publications, to agree with him on this point.
Gengenbach’s book certainly did not appear till
after 1517, and the direct copies from the <i>Liber
Vagatorum</i>, in matter and manner, are too frequent
to admit for one moment of the supposition of their
being accidental. The cant terms, too, are incorrectly
given, and altogether the work bears the appearance
of hasty and piratical compilation. It
never met with that popularity which the author
anticipated, and probably never crossed the frontiers
of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The latest prose edition of the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i>
was issued towards the close of the seventeenth century.
The title ran:—<i>Expertus in truffis. Of
False Beggars and their knaveries. A pretty little
book, made more than a century and a half since, together
with a Vocabulary of some old cant words that
occur therein, newly edited.</i> Anno 1668 (12<sup>o</sup>. pp.
160).</p>

to so undignified a little work as <i>The
Book of Vagabonds</i> seems remarkable. At
this period (1528-9) he was in the midst of his labours,
surrounded with difficulties and cares, and
with every moment of his time fully occupied. The
Protest of Spires had just been signed by the first
Protestants. Melancthon, in great affliction at the
turbulent state of affairs, was running from city to
city; and all Germany was alarmed to hear that the
dreaded Turks were preparing to make battle before
Vienna. Yet, the centre of all this agitation, engaged
in directing and assisting his followers, Luther found
time to write several popular pieces, and kept, we are
told, the book-hawkers of Augsburg and Spires busy
in supplying them to the people. These Christian
pamphlets, D’Aubigné informs us, were eagerly
sought for and passed through numberless editions.
It was not the peasants and townspeople only who
read them, but nobles and princes. Luther intended<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">Pg xx</a></span>
that they should be popular. He knew better than
any man of his time how to captivate the reader and
fix his attention. His little books were short, easy
to read, full of homely sayings and current phrases,
and ornamented with curious engravings. They
were generally written, too, in Latin and German,
to suit both the educated and the unlettered. One
was entitled, <i>The Papacy with its Members painted
and described by Dr. Luther</i>. In it figured the
Pope, the cardinal, and all the religious orders.
Under the picture of one of the orders were these
lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">“We can fast and pray the harder,</div>
<div class="line">With an overflowing larder.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Not one of these orders,” said Luther to the
reader, “thinks either of faith or charity. This
one wears the tonsure, the other a hood, this a cloak,
that a robe. One is white, another black, a third
gray, and a fourth blue. Here is one holding a
looking-glass, there one with a pair of scissors. Each
has his playthings.... Ah! these are the
palmer-worms, the locusts, the canker-worms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">Pg xxi</a></span>
the caterpillars which, as Joel saith, have eaten up
all the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>In this style Luther addressed his readers—scourging
the Pope, his cardinals, and all their emissaries.
But another class of “locusts” besides these
appeared to him to require sweeping away,—these
were the beggars and vagabonds who imitated the
Mendicant Friars in wandering up and down the
country, with lying tales of distress, either of mind
or body. As he says in his Preface, explaining the
reason of his connection with the book, “I thought it
a good thing that such a work should not only be
published, but that it should become known everywhere,
in order that men can see and understand how
mightily the devil rules in this world; and I have also
thought how such a book may help mankind to be
wise, and on the look out for him, viz. the devil.”</p>

<p>Luther further adds—not forgetting, in passing,
to give a blow to Papacy—“Princes, lords, counsellors
of state, and everybody should be prudent,
and cautious in dealing with beggars, and learn that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">Pg xxii</a></span>whereas people will not give and help honest paupers
and needy neighbours, as ordained by God,
they give, by the persuasion of the devil, and contrary
to God’s judgment, ten times as much to vagabonds
and desperate rogues,—in like manner as
we have hitherto done to monasteries, cloisters,
churches, chapels, and Mendicant Friars, forsaking
all the time the truly poor.”</p>

<p>This was Luther’s object in affixing his name to
the little book. He saw that the Friars, Beggars,
and Jews were eating up his country, and he thought
that a graphic account of the various orders of
vagrants, together with a list of their secret or cant
words, issued under the authority of his name, would
put people on their guard, and help to suppress the
wretched system.</p>

<p>Luther’s statement as to his own experience with
these rogues is very <i>naïve</i>—“I have myself of late
years,” he remarks, “been cheated and slandered by
such tramps and liars more than I care to confess.”</p>

<p>Both priests and beggars regarded him with a
peculiar aversion, and many were the nicknames and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">Pg xxiii</a></span>
vulgar terms applied to him. The slang language
of the day, therefore, was not unknown to Luther.</p>

<p>At page 204 of <i>Williams’ Lectures on Ecclesiastical
History</i>, 4to. (apparently privately printed for the
use of the students of St. Begh’s College,) is the
following foot-note:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of the violence with which Luther’s enemies attacked his
character, and strove to render his name and memory odious to
the people, we have an example in the following production of a
French Jesuit, Andreas Frusius, printed at Cologne, 1582:—</p>

<h3><span class="h">ENGLISH BOOKS ON VAGABONDS</span></h3>

<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/i.png" width="60" height="61" alt="I" /></span> MUST now say something about the little
books on vagabonds which appeared in
this country fifty years after the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i>
had become popular in Germany. The first
and principal of these was edited by Thomas Harman,
a gentleman who lived in the days of Queen
Elizabeth, and who appears to have spent a considerable
portion of his time in ascertaining the artifices
and manœuvres of rogues and beggars. From a close
comparison of his work with the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i>, I
have little hesitation in saying that he obtained the
idea and general arrangement, together with a good
deal of the matter, from the German work edited by
Luther. The title of Harman’s book is:—<i>A
Caueat for Cvrsetors vulgarely Called Vagabones, set
forth for the vtilitie and profit of his naturell countrey</i>.</p>

<p>This first appeared in 1566. It was very popular,
and soon ran through four editions, the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">Pg xxv</a></span>
being “augmented and enlarged by the first author
thereof, with the tale of the second taking of the
counterfeit Crank, and the true report of his behaviour
and punishment, most marvellous to the hearer
or reader thereof.”</p>

<p>The dates of the four editions are—</p>

<p>The printer of the third edition is not known.
The book is dedicated, somewhat inconsistently,
considering the nature of the subject, to Elizabeth,
Countess of Shrewsbury. It gives, like the <i>Liber
Vagatorum</i>, short but graphic descriptions of the
different kinds of beggars, and concludes with a cant
dictionary.</p>

<p>The next work on this subject which appeared
in England was published nine years later:—</p>

<p><i>The Fraternitye of Vacabondes, with a Description
of the crafty Company of Cousoners and Shifters;</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">Pg xxvi</a></span>
<i>whereunto also is adioyned the XXV Orders of Knaues,
other wise called a Quartern of Knaues. Confirmed
for ever by Cocke Lorell.</i> (<i>London by John Awdeley</i>,
4to. 1575.)<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Some have conjectured that it was an original
compilation by Audley, the printer; but this little
book, perhaps more than Harman’s, shows traces of
the German work. The “XXV Orders of Knaues”
is nearly the number described in the <i>Liber Vagatorum</i>,
and the tricks, and description of beggars’
dresses in both are very similar. There are the
rogues with patched cloaks, who begged with their
wives and “doxies;” those with forged licenses
and letters, who pretended to collect for hospitals;
those afflicted with the falling sickness, a numerous
number; some without tongues, carrying letters,
pretending they have been signed and sealed by the
authorities of the towns from whence they came;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">Pg xxvii</a></span>others, “freshe-water mariners,” with tales of a
dreadful shipwreck, and many more, all described in
similar words, whether in the pages of the <i>Liber
Vagatorum</i>, Harman, or Audley. It is reasonable
to suppose, therefore, that the German account,
being in the hands of the people abroad half a century
before anything of the kind was issued here,
copies must have found their way to England, and
that from these the other two were in a great measure
derived.</p>

<p>I might remark that other accounts of English
vagabonds were published soon after this. The
subject had become popular, and a demand for
books of the kind was the result. Harrison, who
wrote the <i>Description of England</i>, prefixed to <i>Holinshed’s
Chronicle</i> (1577), describes the different
orders of beggars. Greene, about 1592, wrote several
works, based mainly on old Harman’s book;
and Decker, twenty years later, provided a similar
batch, giving an account of the vagabonds and loose
characters of his day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">Pg xxviii</a></span></p>



<p>Shakespeare, too, and other dramatists of the
period, introduced beggars and mendicants into
their plays in company with the Gipsies, with
whom, in a great measure, in this country they
were allied.</p>

<h3><span class="h">ANCIENT CUSTOMS OF ENGLISH BEGGARS</span></h3>

<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;"><img src="images/a.png" width="60" height="62" alt="A" /></span>MONGST those passages which refer to
the customs and tricks of beggars, in the
<i>Liber Vagatorum</i>, there are few which
receive illustration by a reference to the early laws
and statutes of this country.</p>

<p>The licenses, or “letters with seals,” so frequently
alluded to, and which were granted to deserving
poor people by the civil authorities, are mentioned
as customary in this country in the Act for the
ordering of Vagrants, passed in the reign of Henry
VIII. (1531). It appears that the parish officers
were compelled by this statute to make inquiry into
the condition of the poor, and to ascertain who were
really impotent and who were impostors. To a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">Pg xxix</a></span>
person actually in want liberty was given to beg
within a certain district, “and further,” says the
Act, “there shall be delivered to every such person
a letter containing the name of that person, witnessing
that he is authorized to beg, and the limits
within which he is appointed to beg, the same letter
to be sealed with the seal of the hundred, rape,
wapentake, city, or borough, and subscribed with
the name of one of the said justices or officers aforesaid.”</p>

<p>I need scarcely remark that a seal in those days,
when but few public functionaries could write, was
looked upon as the badge of authority and genuineness,
and that as the art of writing became more
general autograph signatures supplanted seals. An
English vagabond in the time of Elizabeth, when
speaking of his passport, called it his <span class="smcap lowercase">JARKE</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">JARKEMAN</span>, viz. his sealed paper. His descendant
of the present century would term it his <span class="smcap lowercase">LINES</span>,
viz. his written paper. The cant term <span class="smcap lowercase">JARKE</span> is
almost obsolete, but the powerful magic of a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">Pg xxx</a></span>
seal is still remembered and made use of by the
tribe of cadgers. When a number of them at
the present day wait upon a farmer with a fictitious
paper, authorizing them to collect subscriptions for
the sufferers in some dreadful colliery accident, the
document, covered with apparently genuine signatures,
is generally garnished with a huge seal.</p>

<p>In Germany it was the custom (alluded to at
page <a href="#Page_34">34</a>) for the priests or clerks to read these
licenses to beg from the pulpit, that the congregation
might know which of the poor people who
waited at their doors were worthy of alms. Sometimes,
as in the case of the <span class="smcap">Dützbetterin</span>, or
false “lying-in-woman,” an anecdote of whom is
told here, the priests were deceived by counterfeit
documents.</p>

<p>At page <a href="#Page_17">17</a> reference is made to the wandering
students who used to trudge over the country and
sojourn for a time at any school charitable enough
to take them in. These, in their journeys, often fell
in with rogues and tramps, and sometimes joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">Pg xxxi</a></span>
them in their vagabond calling, in which case they
obtained for themselves the title of <span class="smcap">Kammesierers</span>,
or “Learned Beggars.” Now these same vagabond
scholars were to be met with in this country
in the time of Henry VIII,—and in Ireland, I believe,
so late as the last century. Examining again
the Act for Vagrants, 1531, we find that it was
usual and customary for poor scholars from Oxford
and Cambridge to tramp from county to county.
The statute provided them with a document, signed
by the commissary, chancellor, or vice-chancellor,
which acted as their passport. When found without
this license they were treated as vagrants, and
whipped accordingly.</p>

<h3><span class="h">GERMAN ORIGIN OF TRICS PRACTISED BY ENGLISH VAGABONDS</span></h3>

<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;"><img src="images/i.png" width="60" height="61" alt="I" /></span>T is remarkable that many of the tricks
and manœuvres to obtain money from the
unthinking but benevolent people of Luther’s
time should have been practised in this country
at an early date, and that they should still be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">Pg xxxii</a></span>
amongst the arts to deceive thoughtless persons
adopted by rogues and tramps at the present day.
The stroller, or “Master of the Black Art,” described
at page <a href="#Page_19">19</a>, is yet occasionally heard of in
our rural districts. The simple farmer believes him
to be weather and cattle wise, and should his crops
be backward, or his cow “Spot,” not “let down
her milk,” with her accustomed readiness, he crosses
the fellow’s hand with a piece of silver, in order that
things may be righted.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Wiltners</span>, or finders of pretended silver
fingers, noticed at page <a href="#Page_45">45</a>, are now-a-days represented
by the “Fawney Riggers,” or droppers of
counterfeit gold rings,—described in <i>Mayhew’s London
Labour</i>, and other works treating of the ways of
vagabonds.</p>

<p>“Card-Sharpers,” or <span class="smcap">Joners</span>, mentioned at page
47, are, unfortunately for the pockets of the simple,
still to be met with on public race-courses and at
fairs.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">over-Sönzen-goers</span>, or pretended distressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">Pg xxxiii</a></span>
gentry, who went about “neatly dressed,” with false
letters, would seem to have been the original of our
modern “Begging-Letter-Writers.”</p>

<p>Those half-famished looking impostors, with clean
aprons, or carefully brushed threadbare coats, who
stand on the curbs of our public thoroughfares, and
beg with a few sticks of sealing-wax in their hands,
were known in Luther’s time as <span class="smcap">Goose-shearers</span>.
As the reader will have experienced only too frequently,
they have, when pretending to be mechanics
out of employ, a particularly unpleasant practice of
following people, and detailing, in half-despairing,
half-threatening sentences, the state of their pockets
and their appetites. It appears they did the same
thing more than three centuries ago.</p>

<p>Another class, known amongst London street-folk
as “Shivering-Jemmies,”—fellows who expose themselves,
half-naked, on a cold day, to excite pity and
procure alms—were known in Luther’s time as
<span class="smcap">Schwanfelders</span>,—only in those days, people being
not quite so modest as now, they stripped them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">Pg xxxiv</a></span>selves
entirely naked before commencing to shiver
at the church-doors.</p>

<p>Those wretches, who are occasionally brought
before the police magistrates, accused of maiming
children, on purpose that they may the better excite
pity and obtain money, are, unfortunately, not
peculiar to our civilized age. These fellows committed
like cruelties centuries ago.</p>

<p>Borrowers of children, too,—those pretended fathers
of numerous and starving families of urchins,
now often heard howling in the streets on a wet
day, the children being arranged right and left according
to height,—existed in the olden time,—only
then the loan was but for All Souls’, or other
Feast Day, when the people were in a good humour.</p>

<p>The trick of placing soap in the mouth to produce
froth, and falling down before passers-by as
though in a fit, common enough in London streets
a few years ago, is also described as one of the old
manœuvres of beggars.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">Pg xxxv</a></span></p>
<p>Travelling quack-doctors, against whom Luther
cautions his readers, were common in this country
up to the beginning of the present century.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> And
it is not long ago since the credulous countrymen
in our rural districts, were cheated by fellows—“wise-men”
they preferred being termed—who
pretended to divine dreams, and say under which
tree or wall the hidden treasure, so plainly seen by
Hodge in his sleep carefully deposited in a crock,
was to be found. This pleasant idea of a pot full
of gold, being buried near everybody, seems to
have possessed people in all ages. In Luther’s time
the nobility and clergy appear to have been sadly
troubled with it, and it is very amusing to learn
that so simple in this respect were the latter, that
after they had given “gold and silver” to the cunning
treasure-seeker, this worthy would insist upon
their offering up masses in order that the digging
might be attended with success!</p>

<p>And lastly, the travelling tinkers,—who appear to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">Pg xxxvi</a></span>have had no better name for honesty in the fifteenth
century than they have now,—“going about breaking
holes in people’s kettles to give work to a multitude
of others,” says the little book.</p>

<h3><span class="h">OLD GERMAN CANT WORDS</span></h3>

<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;"><img src="images/w.png" width="60" height="58" alt="W" /></span>ITH regard to the Rothwelsch Sprache, or
cant language used by these vagrants, it
appears, like nearly all similar systems of
speech, to be founded on allegory. Many of the
terms, as in the case of the ancient cant of this country,
appear to be compound corruptions,—two or
more words, in ordinary use, twisted and pronounced
in such a way as to hide their original meaning.
As Luther states, in his preface, the Hebrew appears
to be a principal element. Occasionally a term
from a neighbouring country, or from a dead language
may be observed, but not frequently. As
they occur in the original I have retained those cant
words which are to be found here and there in the
text. Perhaps it would have rendered a perusal less<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">Pg xxxvii</a></span>
tedious had they been placed as foot-notes; but I
preferred to adhere to the form in which Luther was
content the little book should go forth to the world.
The simple form of these secret terms has generally
been given, there being no established rule for their
inflection. In a few instances I found myself unable
to give English equivalents to the cant words
in the Vocabulary, so was compelled to leave them
unexplained, but with the old German meanings
(not easy to be unravelled) attached.</p>

<h3><i>MARTIN LUTHER’S PREFACE.</i></h3>


<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="60" height="58" alt="" /></span>
<i>HIS little book about the knaveries of beggars
was first printed by one who called
himself</i> Expertus in Truffis, <i>that is, a
fellow right expert in roguery,—which
the little work very well proves, even though he had
not given himself such a name.</i></p>

<p><i>But I have thought it a good thing that such a book
should not only be printed, but that it should become
known everywhere, in order that men may see and understand
how mightily the devil rules in this world;
and I have also thought how such a book may help
mankind to be wise, and on the look out for him, viz.
the devil. Truly, such Beggars’ Cant has come from
the Jews, for many Hebrew words occur in the Vocabulary,
as any one who understands that language may
perceive.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">Pg 4</a></span></p>

<p><i>But the right understanding and true meaning of
the book is, after all, this, viz. that princes, lords,
counsellors of state, and everybody should be prudent,
and cautious in dealing with beggars, and learn that,
whereas people will not give and help honest paupers
and needy neighbours, as ordained by God, they give,
by the persuasion of the devil, and contrary to God’s
judgment, ten times as much to Vagabonds and desperate
rogues,—in like manner as we have hitherto done
to monasteries, cloisters, churches, chapels, and mendicant

<p><i>For this reason every town and village should know
their own paupers, as written down in the Register,
and assist them. But as to outlandish and strange
beggars they ought not to be borne with, unless they
have proper letters and certificates; for all the great
rogueries mentioned in this book are done by these. If
each town would only keep an eye upon their paupers,
such knaveries would soon be at an end. I have myself
of late years been cheated and befooled by such</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">Pg 5</a></span>

<img src="images/t.jpg" width="60" height="58" alt="" /></span>HE first chapter is about <span class="smcap">Bregers</span>. These
are beggars who have neither the signs
of the saints about them, nor other good
qualities, but they come plainly and simply to
people and ask an alms for God’s, or the Holy
Virgin’s sake:—perchance honest paupers with
young children, who are known in the town or
village wherein they beg, and who would, I doubt<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">Pg 9</a></span>
not, leave off begging if they could only thrive by
their handicraft or other honest means, for there is
many a godly man who begs unwillingly, and feels
ashamed before those who knew him formerly
when he was better off, and before he was compelled
to beg. Could he but proceed without he
would soon leave begging behind him.</p>

<p><i>Conclusio</i>: To these beggars it is proper to give,
for such alms are well laid out.<br /><br /></p>

their wives (<span class="smcap lowercase">KRÖNERIN</span>) and children (<span class="smcap lowercase">GATZAM</span>)
going (<span class="smcap lowercase">ALCHEN</span>) with them. Their hats (<span class="smcap lowercase">WETTERHAN</span>)
and cloaks (<span class="smcap lowercase">WINTFANG</span>) hang full of signs
of all the saints,—the cloak (wintfang) being made
(<span class="smcap lowercase">VETZEN</span>) out of a hundred pieces. They go to<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">Pg 10</a></span>
the peasants who give them bread (<span class="smcap lowercase">LEHEM DIPPEN</span>);
and each of these <span class="smcap">Stabülers</span> has six or
seven sacks, and carries a pot, plate, spoon, flask,
and whatever else is needed for the journey with
him. These same <span class="smcap">Stabülers</span> never leave off
begging, nor do their children, from their infancy
to the day of their death—for the beggar’s staff
keeps the fingers (<span class="smcap lowercase">GRIFFLING</span>) warm—and they
neither will nor can work, and their children (<span class="smcap lowercase">GATZAM</span>)
grow up to be harlots and harlotmongers

these <span class="smcap">Stabülers</span> come, in town or country, they
beg; at one house for God’s sake, at another for
St. Valentine’s sake, at a third for St. Kürine’s, <i>sic

from whom they seek alms. For they do not adhere
to one patron or trust to one method alone.</p>

among the infidel (<i>id est</i>, in the <span class="smcap lowercase">SONNENBOSS</span>,
<i>i.e.</i> brothel) for their christian faith; <i>item</i>, on the
sea in galleys or ships enchained in iron fetters;
<i>item</i>, in a strong tower for innocence’ sake; and
they have forged letters (<span class="smcap lowercase">LOE BSAFFOT</span>), as from
the princes and lords of foreign lands, and from
the towns (<span class="smcap lowercase">KIELAM</span>) there, to bear witness to their
truth, tho’ all the time they are deceit and lies
(<span class="smcap lowercase">GEVOPT</span> und <span class="smcap lowercase">GEVERBT</span>),—— for vagabonds may
be found everywhere on the road who can make
(<span class="smcap lowercase">VETZEN</span>) any seal they like—— and they say they
have vowed to Our Lady at Einsiedlin (in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DALLINGER’S BOSS</span>, <i>i.e.</i> harlot’s house), or to some
<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">Pg 12</a></span>other Saint (in the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHÖCHERBOSS</span>, <i>i.e.</i> beer-house),
according to what country they are in, a pound of
wax, a silver crucifix, or a chasuble; and they say
they have been made free through that vow, and,
when they had vowed, the chains opened and
broke, and they departed safe and without harm.
<i>Item</i>, some carry iron fastenings, or coats of mail
(<span class="smcap lowercase">PANZER</span>) with them, <i>et sic de aliis</i>. <i>Nota:</i> They
have perchance bought (<span class="smcap lowercase">KÜMMERT</span>) the chains;

<img src="images/t.jpg" width="60" height="58" alt="" /></span>HE iiij<sup>th</sup> is about the <span class="smcap">Klenkners</span>. These
are the beggars who sit at the church-doors,
and attend fairs and church gatherings
with sore and broken legs; one has no foot,
another no shank, a third no hand or arm. <i>Item</i>,
some have chains lying by them, saying they have
lain in captivity for innocence’ sake, and commonly
they have a St. Sebastianum or St. Lenhartum
with them, and they pray and cry with a loud
voice and noisy lamentations for the sake of the
Saints, and every third word one of them speaks
(<span class="smcap lowercase">BARL</span>) is a lie (<span class="smcap lowercase">GEVOP</span>), and the people who give
alms to him are cheated (<span class="smcap lowercase">BESEFELT</span>),—inasmuch
as his thigh or his foot has rotted away in prison
or in the stocks for wicked deeds. <i>Item</i>, one’s
hand has been chopped off in the quarrels over
dice or for the sake of a harlot. <i>Item</i>, many a one
ties a leg up or besmears an arm with salves, or<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">Pg 14</a></span>
walks on crutches, and all the while as little ails
him as other men. <i>Item</i>, at Utenheim there was a
priest by name Master Hans Ziegler (he holds
now the benefice of Rosheim), and he had his niece
with him. One upon crutches came before his
house. His niece carried him a piece of bread.
He said, “Wilt thou give me nought else?” She
said, “I have nought else.” He replied, “Thou
old priest’s harlot! wilt thou make thy parson
rich?” and swore many oaths as big as he could
utter them. She cried and came into the room and
told the priest. The priest went out and ran after
him. The beggar dropped his crutches and fled so
fast that the parson could not catch him. A short
time afterwards the parson’s house was burnt down;
he said the <span class="smcap">Klenkner</span> did it. <i>Item</i>, another true
example: at Schletstat, one was sitting at the church-door.
This man had cut the leg of a thief from
the gallows. He put on the dead leg and tied his
own leg up. He had a quarrel with another beggar.
This latter one ran off and told the town<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">Pg 15</a></span>serjeant.
When he saw the serjeant coming he fled
and left the sore leg behind him and ran out of the
town—a horse could hardly have overtaken him.
Soon afterwards he hung on the gallows at Achern,
and the dry leg beside him, and they called him
Peter of Kreuzenach. <i>Item</i>, they are the biggest
blasphemers thou canst find who do such things;
and they have also the finest harlots (<span class="smcap lowercase">GLIDEN</span>), they
are the first-comers at fairs and church-celebrations,
and the last-goers therefrom.</p>

<p><i>Conclusio</i>: Give them a kick on their hind parts if
thou canst, for they are nought but cheats (<span class="smcap lowercase">BESEFLER</span>)
of the peasants (<span class="smcap lowercase">HANZEN</span>) and all other men.</p>

<p>Example: One was called Uz of Lindau. He
was at Ulm, in the hospital there, for xiiij days,
and on St. Sebastian’s day he lay before a church,
his hands and thighs tied up, nevertheless he could
use both legs and hands. This was betrayed to the
constables. When he saw them coming he fled
from the town,—a horse could hardly have ran
faster.<br /><br /></p>

sickness of St. Valentine, or St. Kurinus, or St. Vitus,
or St. Antonius, and have offered myself to the
Holy Saint (<i>ut supra</i>) with vj pounds of wax, with an
altar cloth, with a silver salver (<i>et cetera</i>), and must
bring these together from pious people’s offerings and
help; therefore I beg you to contribute a heller, a
spindleful of flax, a ribbon, or some linen yarn for
the altar, that God and the Holy Saint may protect
you from misery and disease and the falling sickness.”
<i>Nota</i>: A false (<span class="smcap lowercase">LOE</span>) trick.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, some fall down before the churches, or in
other places with a piece of soap in their mouths,
whereby the foam rises as big as a fist, and they prick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">Pg 22</a></span>
their nostrils with a straw, causing them to bleed, as
though they had the falling-sickness. <i>Nota</i>: this
is utter knavery. These are villanous vagrants that
infest all countries. <i>Item</i>, there are many who speak
(<span class="smcap lowercase">BARLEN</span>) thus:—“Listen to me, dear friends, I am
a butcher’s son, a tradesman. And it happened some
time since that a vagrant came to my father’s house
and begged for St. Valentine’s sake; and my father
gave me a penny to give to him. I said, ‘father, it is
knavery.’ My father told me to give it to him, but
I gave it him not. And since that hour I have been
afflicted with the falling-sickness, and I have made
a vow to St. Valentine of iij pounds of wax and a
High Mass, and I beg and pray pious folks to help
me, because I have made this vow; otherwise I
should have substance enough for myself. Therefore
I ask of you an offering and help that the dear holy
St. Valentine may guard and protect you evermore.”
<i>Nota</i>: what he says is all lies. <i>Item</i>, he has been
more than xx years collecting for his iij pounds of
wax and the mass, and has been gambling (<span class="smcap lowercase">VERJONEN</span>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">Pg 23</a></span>
bibbling (<span class="smcap lowercase">VERSCHÖCHERN</span>), and rioting

other and more subtle words than those given in this
book. <i>Item</i>, some have a written testimony (<span class="smcap lowercase">BSAFFOT</span>)
that it is all true.</p>

<p><i>Conclusio</i>: If any of the <span class="smcap">Grantners</span> cometh
before thine house, and simply beggeth for God’s
sake, and speaketh not many, nor flowery words, to
them thou shalt give, for there are many men who

speak of great wonders, tell you that they have
made vows, and can altogether skilfully use their
tongues—these are signs that they have followed this

false and not to be trusted. As to him who believes
them, they take a nut off his tree. Take care

<img src="images/t.jpg" width="60" height="58" alt="" /></span>HE ix<sup>th</sup> chapter is about the <span class="smcap">Dutzers</span>.
These are beggars who have been ill for a
long time, as they say, and have promised
a difficult pilgrimage to this or that Saint (<i>ut supra
in precedenti capitulo</i>) for three whole and entire
alms every day, that they, thereby, must go each
day from door to door until they find three pious
men who will give them three entire alms. Thus
speaketh a pious man unto them: “What is an entire
alms?” Whereat the <span class="smcap">Dutzer</span> replieth: “A
‘plaphart’ (<i>blaffard</i>), whereof I must have three
every day, and take no less, for without that the
pilgrimage is no good.” Some go for iij pennies,
some for one penny, <i>et in toto nihil</i>. And the alms
they “must have from a good and correct man.”
Such is the vanity of women, rather than be called
impious they give a double “blaffard,” and send
the <span class="smcap">Dutzer</span> one to another, who uses many other
<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">Pg 25</a></span>
words which I cannot make bold to repeat. <i>Item</i>,
they would take a hundred “blaffards” and more a
day if they were given them, and what they say
is all lies (<span class="smcap lowercase">GEVOPT</span>). <i>Item</i>, this also is <span class="smcap lowercase">DUTZING</span>, viz.
when a beggar comes to thine house and speaks:
“Good woman, might I ask you for a spoonful of
butter; I have many young children, and I want the
wherewith to cook soup for them?” <i>Item</i>, for an
egg (<span class="smcap lowercase">BETZAM</span>): “I have a child bedridden now these
seven days.” <i>Item</i>, for a mouthful of wine, “for I
have a sick wife,” <i>et sic de aliis</i>. This is called
<span class="smcap lowercase">DUTZING</span>.</p>

<p><i>Conclusio</i>: Give nought whatsoever to those
<span class="smcap">Dutzers</span> who say that they have taken a vow not
to gather more <i>per diem</i> than iij or iiij entire alms,
<i>ut supra</i>. They are half good (<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNT</span>), and half
bad (<span class="smcap lowercase">LÖTSCH</span>); but the greater part bad.<br /><br /></p>

These are <span class="smcap">Kammesierers</span> who pretend to
be priests. They come to the houses with
a <i>famulus</i> or <i>discipulus</i> who carries a sack after
them, and speak thus:—“Here comes a consecrated
man, named Master George Kessler, of Kitzebühel
(or what else he likes to call himself) and I am of
such-and-such a village, or of such-and-such a family
(naming a family which they know), and I will
officiate at my first mass on such-and-such a day in
that village, and I was consecrated for the altar in
such-and-such a town at such-and-such a church,
and there is no altar cloth, nor is there a missal, <i>et
cetera</i>, and I cannot afford them without much help
from all men; for mark, whosoever is commended
for an offering in the angel’s requiem, or for as
many pennies as he gives, so many souls will be released
amongst his deceased kindred.” <i>Item</i>, they<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">Pg 27</a></span>
receive also the farmer (<span class="smcap lowercase">HANZ</span>) and his wife
(<span class="smcap lowercase">HANZIN</span>) into a brotherhood, which they say had
bestowed on it grace and a great indulgence from
the bishop who is to erect the altar. Thus men
are moved to pity; one gives linen yarn, another
flax or hemp; one table cloths, or towels, or old
silver plate; and the <span class="smcap">Schleppers</span> say that they are
not a brotherhood like the others who have <i>questionerer</i>,
and who come every year, but that they
will come no more (for if they came again they
would certainly be drowned [<span class="smcap lowercase">GEFLÖSSELT</span>]). <i>Item</i>,
this manner is greatly practised in the Black
Forest, and in the country of Bregenz, in Kurwalen,
and in the Bar, and in the Algen, and on the
Adige, and in Switzerland, where there are not many
priests, and where the churches are far distant from
each other,—as are also the farms.</p>

<p><i>Conclusio</i>: To these <span class="smcap">Schleppers</span>, or Knaves,
give nothing, for it would be badly laid out.</p>

invited the farmers to his first mass at St. Gallen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">Pg 28</a></span>

him in the cathedral, but found him not. After

the power of God,—they go on a pilgrimage, and
when they come into a town they hide their round
hats, and say to the people they have been stolen
from them, or lost at the places where they had
sheltered themselves, and one of them often collects
ten or xx caps, and then sells them. Some are
called blind who have lost their sight by evil-doings
and wickednesses. They wander about in the country
and carry with them pictures of devils, and repair<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">Pg 29</a></span>
to the churches, and pretend they had been at
Rome, to Saint James, and other distant places, and
speak of great signs and wonders that had taken
place, but it is all lies and deception. Some of the
blind men are called <span class="smcap lowercase">BROKEN WANDERERS</span> (Bruch
Umbgeen). These are such as have been blinded
ten years or more; they take cotton, and make the
cotton bloody, and then with a kerchief tie this
over their eyes, and say that they have been mercers
or pedlers, and were blinded by wicked men
in a forest, that they were tied fast to a tree and so

These are the beggarwomen who
lay themselves before the churches all over

altho’ some of them have not had one these x or xx
years; and they are called <span class="smcap">Dützbetterins</span>. To
these nothing is to be given,—<i>causa</i>: There lay once,
at Strasburg, a man underneath a sheet before the
cathedral, and it was pretended he was a woman in
childbed. But he was taken by the town serjeants,<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">Pg 34</a></span>
and put into a halsong, and in the pillory, and then
he was forbidden the country. There are likewise
some women who pretend they have been pregnant
with a monster and have brought forth such, as did
a woman who came to Pforzheim in the year one
thousand five hundred and nine. This same woman
said that a short time before she had given
birth to a child and a live toad; and that this very
toad she had carried to Our Lady at Einsiedeln,
where it was still alive, and that it must have a
pound of meat every day,—being kept at Einsiedeln
as a miracle. Thus she begs alms as if she were on
her way to Ach, to Our Lady. She had also a letter
with a seal, which was proclaimed from the pulpit.
The same woman, however, had a lusty young man
whom she kept in food by such villany, sitting in
an alehouse in the suburb waiting for her. All this
was found out by the gate-keeper; and they would
have been seized, but they had been warned and so
took themselves off. <i>Nota</i>: All this was utter

and they are called <span class="smcap">Schweigers</span>.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;"><img src="images/t.jpg" width="60" height="58" alt="" /></span>HE xxviij<sup>th</sup> chapter is about the <span class="smcap">Platschierers</span>.
These are the blind men who
sit before the churches on chairs, and play
on the lute, and sing various songs of foreign lands
whither they have never been, and when they have
done singing they begin to <span class="smcap lowercase">VOP</span> (to lie) and <span class="smcap lowercase">FERB</span> in
what manner they had lost their eye-sight. <i>Item</i>, the
hangmen (<span class="smcap">Platschierers</span>) also before the <span class="smcap lowercase">DIFTEL</span>
door (church-door) will take their clothes off till
they are stark-naked, and lash themselves with whips
and sticks for the sake of their sins, and they do this
<span class="smcap lowercase">VOPPERY</span> to cheat mankind, as thou hast just heard
in the previous chapter; and this is called <span class="smcap lowercase">PLATSCHIERING</span>.
Also those who stand on stools, and lash
themselves with stones and other things, and talk
about the saints, usually become hangmen and slayers.</p>

<h3>¶ <span class="smcap">The Second Part.</span></h3>



<p class="indent"><i>This is the Second Part of this Book, which speaketh
of several</i> Notabilia <i>that relate to the afore-mentioned
customs and methods of getting a living, given
in a few words.</i></p>

<p><span class="h">xxxx</span></p>

<p class="chap"><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;"><img src="images/i.png" width="60" height="61" alt="I" /></span><i>TEM</i>, there are some of the afore-mentioned
who neither ask before a house nor
at the door, but step right into the house,
or into the chamber, whether any body be within
or no. It is from no good reason. These thou
knowest thyself.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, there are also some that go up and down the
aisles of churches, and carry a cup in their hands.
They wear clothes suitable for this purpose, and pass
about very infirm as tho’ they were strangely ill, and
go from one to the other, and bow towards those
people who are likely to give them something.
They are called <span class="smcap">Pflügers</span>.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, there are also some who borrow children
upon All Souls’ or other Feast Day, and sit down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">Pg 44</a></span>
before the churches as tho’ they had many children,
and they say “these children are motherless” or
“fatherless,” but it is not true. This is done in
order that people may give to them the more willingly
for the sake of <span class="smcap">Adone</span> (God).</p>

<p><i>Exemplum</i>: In a village in Switzerland, there
is a statute whereby they give to every beggar vs.
hellers on condition that he shall for a quarter of a
year at least not beg in the same neighbourhood.
Once a woman took these same vs. hellers on condition
that she would not beg any more in the
neighbourhood. After that she cut her hair off,
and begged up and down the country, and came
again to Swytz, into the village, and sat down at the
church gate with a young child. When the child
was uncovered it was found to be a dog. Then she
had to run away from the country. This person
was called <i>Weissenburgerin</i>; she had been in prison
at Zurich combing wool.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, there are some who put on good clothes
and beg in the streets. They accost any person, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">Pg 45</a></span>
it woman or man, and say, they have lain ill a long
time, and are mechanics who have expended all their
goods and are ashamed to beg, and ask that thou
mayest help them to proceed on their journey. These
are called <span class="smcap">Goose-shearers</span>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><i>Item</i>, there are likewise some among those beforementioned
who pretend they can dig or search for
hidden treasures, and when they find some one who
allows himself to be persuaded, they say they must
have gold and silver, and must have many masses
celebrated to this same end, <i>et cetera</i>, with many
more words added. Thereby they deceive the nobility,
the clergy, and also the laity, for it has not
yet been heard that such villains have found these
valuables. But they have cheated people enough.
They are called <span class="smcap">Sefel</span>-(dirt-)<span class="smcap lowercase">DIGGERS</span>.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, there are also some among the above who
treat their children badly in order that they may become
lame (and who would be sorry if they should
grow straight-legged) for thereby they are more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">Pg 46</a></span>able to cheat people with their <span class="smcap lowercase">LOE VOTS</span> (lying
words).</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, there are also others among the above who,
when they come into the villages, have a little counterfeit
finger and dirt<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> upon it, smearing it all over,
and say they have found it, and ask if somebody
will buy it. Thus a silly peasant’s wife (<span class="smcap lowercase">HANZIN</span>)
thinks it is silver, and knows it not, and gives them
vi pennies or more for it, and therewith she is cheated.
In like manner with <i>pater nosters</i>, or other signs which
they carry underneath their cloaks. They are called
<span class="smcap">Wiltners</span>.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, there are also some <span class="smcap">Questionerers</span> (persons
who ask alms) who make evil use of the holy
goods which they receive, be it flax, linen-cloth,
broken silver plate, or other things; they are easily
detected by those who are knowing, but the common
man will soon be cheated. I give to no <span class="smcap">Questioner</span>
anything, excepting the four messengers, <i>id est</i>,
those that are here written down, viz. <i>Sancti Antonii</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">Pg 47</a></span>
<i>Sancti Valentini</i>, <i>Sancti Bernardi</i>, <i>et Spiritus
Sancti</i>. The same have been confirmed by the See
of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p><i>Item</i>, beware of the pedlers who seek thee at
home, for thou wilt buy nothing good of them, be it
silver, haberdashery, spicery, or any other wares.</p>

<p>Beware, likewise, of the doctors who travel up
and down the country, and offer theriack and roots,
and make much ado about themselves, and especially
some blind doctors. One called Hans of Strasburg,
has been a Jew, and was christened at Strasburg at
Whitsuntide; years ago his eyes were bored out at
Worms, but he is now a physician, and tells fortunes,
and travels from place to place, and cheats and
defrauds every body. How? I need not say, I
could tell well enough.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, beware of the <span class="smcap">Joners</span> (gamblers) who practice
<span class="smcap lowercase">BESEFLERY</span> with the <span class="smcap lowercase">BRIEF</span> (cheating at cards),
who <i>deal</i> falsely and <i>cut</i> one for the other, cheat with
<span class="smcap lowercase">BÖGLEIN</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">SPIES</span>, pick one <span class="smcap lowercase">BRIEF</span> (card) from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">Pg 48</a></span>ground, and another from a cupboard; they cheat
also with the <span class="smcap lowercase">REGERS</span> (dice); with <i>hearts</i>, the <i>chest</i>,
in <i>taking off</i> and in <i>laying on</i>, with <span class="smcap lowercase">METZES</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">STABS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">GUMNES</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PRISSING</span>, with the <i>four knaves</i>; they use
<span class="smcap lowercase">LOE MESS</span> (bad coins), or <span class="smcap lowercase">LOE STETTINGERS</span> (bad
florins), and make use of many other rogueries,
such as <i>drawing out</i>, the <i>rot</i>, <i>the stake</i>, &amp;c., which I
had better not explain, for your own good.</p>

<p>And these same knaves eat and drink always at
such houses as are called the Stick, which means they
never pay the landlord what they owe him, but when
they leave there “sticks” mostly something to them
which commonly departs with them.</p>

<p><i>Item</i>, there is yet another sort among the land-strollers.
These are the <i>tinkers</i> who travel about the
country. They have women (<span class="smcap lowercase">WEIBER</span>) who go before
them and sing and play; some go about full
of mischief, and if thou givest them nothing, one of
them mayhap will break a hole in thy kettle with a
stick or a knife to give work to a multitude of others.</p>

<h3>¶ THE THIRD PART OF THIS<br />

LITTLE BOOK IS THE<br />

VOCABULARY.</h3>


<ul class="IX">
<li><span class="figleft" style="width: 60px;"><img src="images/a.png" width="60" height="62" alt="" /></span>&nbsp;<i>HEDONE</i>, God. <i>Hebrew</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">ADHONAIY</span>, the
Lord, <i>i.e.</i> God.</li>

<li>&nbsp;<i>ACHELN</i>, to eat. <i>Hebrew</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">AKÁL</span>.</li>

<li>&nbsp;<i>ALCHEN!</i> to go.</li>

<li><i>ALCH DICH!</i> go! or, go quickly!</li>

<li><i>ALCH DICH ÜBERN BREITHART!</i> go far away!
remove to a distance!</li>

<li><i>ALCH DICH ÜBERN GLENZ!</i> go far away! remove
to a distance!</li>

<li><i>BARLEN</i>, to speak. <i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PARLER</span>.</li>

<li><i>BESCHÖCHER</i>, tipsy. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BESOFFEN</span>, drunken,
inebriated.</li>

<li><i>BETZAM</i>, an egg. <i>Hebrew</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BEYTZAH</span>.</li>

<li><i>BLECH</i>, a <span class="smcap lowercase">BLAFFART</span>,—an obsolete coin containing 48
hellers. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BLECH</span>, a thin piece of metal.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">Pg 50</a></span>


<i>BLECHLEIN</i>, a kreuzer,—a smaller coin than the preceding,
containing 8 hellers. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BLECHLEIN</span>,
the diminutive of <span class="smcap lowercase">BLECH</span>.</li>

<li><i>BÖLEN</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">HELSEN</span>,—probably the <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">HALSEN</span>, to
embrace any one, to jump at one’s neck (<span class="smcap lowercase">HALS</span>); also
to veer.</li>

<li><i>BOPPEN</i>, to lie; be placed or situated.</li>

<li><i>BOSS</i>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BETT</span>, a house. This term would seem to be
from the <i>Hebrew</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BETH</span>, a house. Bo, or <span class="smcap lowercase">BOS</span>, is a
common prefix in the old <i>Cornish</i>, and signifies a
house, as <span class="smcap lowercase">BOSCAWEN</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BOSPIDNICK</span>.</li>

<li><i>BOSS DICH!</i> hold thy tongue!</li>

<li><i>BOSSHART</i>, meat. The <i>Hebrew</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BÁSAR</span>, signifies flesh.</li>

<li><i>BOSSHART-VETZER</i>, a butcher. <i>Hebrew.</i></li>

<li><i>BREGEN</i>, to beg. Both this and the following are probably
corruptions of the <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PREDIGEN</span>, to
pray, to preach; or they may have come from the
<i>Old German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BRACHER</span>, a pauper. Possibly, however,
they are nothing more than corruptions of
<span class="smcap lowercase">BEGHARD</span>, the name given to a low order of friars
before the Reformation. These professed poverty,
and lived on alms. Their orthodoxy and morality
were doubtful. In general they were denounced by
the ecclesiastical authorities. <i>See</i> Mosheim, <i>de</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">BEGHARDIS</span>
<i>et Beguinis</i>. The term evidently comes from
<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">Pg 51</a></span>the <i>Saxon</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BEGGEN</span>, mendicare; and <span class="smcap lowercase">HARD</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">HART</span>,
a servant.</li>

<li><i>BREGER</i>, a beggar.</li>

<li><i>BREITHART</i>, far, wide,—<span class="smcap lowercase">BREIT</span> here being equivalent
to broad, or wide; and <span class="smcap lowercase">HART</span>, to very, or exceedingly.</li>

<li><i>BREITFUSS</i>, a goose, or duck,—literally, a “broad-foot.”</li>

<li><i>BRESEM</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BRÜCH</span>, to break. The <i>Old German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BRUCH</span>,
signifies <i>fractura</i>, <i>ruptura</i>; <i>femoralia</i>; <i>locus palustris</i>;
<i>infractio legis</i>. The <i>Modern German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BRUCH</span>, refers
to a breach or rupture in a person, especially a breakage
caused by violence.</li>

<li><i>BRIEF</i>, a playing card. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BRIEF</span>, a letter.</li>

<li><i>BRIEFELVETZER</i>, a clerk. <i>Vide</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">FETZEN</span>.</li>

<li><i>BRIEFEN</i>, to play at cards.</li>

<li><i>BRISSEN</i>, to denounce.</li>

<li><i>BRÜSS</i>, a leper.</li>

<li><i>BSAFFOT</i>, a letter, a cipher. The <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">ZIFFER</span>,
signifies a cipher, and probably comes from the
<i>Arabic</i> or <i>Hebrew</i>,—<span class="smcap lowercase">SÉPHER</span> in the latter being
equivalent to writing, a writing, or whatever is written
in a book.</li>

<li><i>BSCHIDERICH</i>, a magistrate. Probably this term, together
with the following, were merely vulgar adaptations
of the <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BESCHEIDEN</span>, to appoint, to be
<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">Pg 52</a></span>discreet. The <i>Old German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">BESCHEID-RIK</span>, might
be translated as “powerful in decision,” and <span class="smcap lowercase">BESCHEIDRUOM</span>,
“renowned for discretion or modesty.”</li>

<li><i>BSCHUDERULM</i>, nobility.</li>

<li><i>BÜTZELMAN</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">ZAGEL</span>. The <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">ZAGEL</span>, is a
provincial word, and signifies a tail. <i>See</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHEISS</span>.</li>

<li><i>DALLINGER</i>, a hangman. Probably a corruption of
<span class="smcap lowercase">GALGENER</span>,—from the <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GALGEN</span>, a gallows,
or gibbet.</li>

<li><i>DERLING</i>, a die (plural <i>dice</i>).</li>

<li><i>DIERLING</i>, the eye. Possibly a diminutive of the
<i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">THÜR</span>, a door, or entrance,—not inappropriately
applied to the eye, as the little door out of which
all things are seen.</li>

<li><i>DIERN</i>, to see.</li>

<li><i>DIFTEL</i>, a church. Probably a corruption of the <i>German</i>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">STIFTEL</span>,—a diminutive of <span class="smcap lowercase">STIFT</span>, a cathedral.
<span class="smcap">Stiftung</span> is a foundation, establishment; <span class="smcap lowercase">STIFTER</span>, a
founder.</li>

<li><i>DIPPEN</i>, to give. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GEBEN</span>.</li>

<li><i>DOLMAN</i>, the gallows. The <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DOLMAN</span>, properly
signifies a pelisse,—the tight-fitting nature of
which may have given rise to the cant application to
a gallows.</li>

<li><i>DOTSCH</i>, <i>vulva</i>. Supposed by some to be from the
<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">Pg 53</a></span><i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TASCHE</span>, a pocket. The <i>Bavarian</i> words
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOTSCH</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DOST</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">DOSTEN</span>, however, still signify <i>vulva</i>.</li>

<li><i>DOUL</i> (<i>i. e.</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">DÖEL</span>,—<span class="smcap lowercase">DAUL</span>), a penny. The fourth part of
a <span class="smcap lowercase">BLECHLEIN</span>, or kreuzer.</li>

<li><i>DRITLING</i>, a shoe. From the <i>Old German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TRITLING</span>,
a footstool, a bench,—a diminutive of <span class="smcap lowercase">TRITT</span>,
<i>gradus</i>, <i>passus incessus</i>, <i>cursus pedestris</i>. <span class="smcap">Tretten</span> is
<i>omnes pedum motus</i>, from the <i>Celtic</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TRUD</span>; <i>Ancient
British</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">TROED</span>,—so that it seems very probable that
<span class="smcap lowercase">TRITLING</span>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">DRITLING</span>, may have meant a little
treader, or shoe.</li>

<li><i>DÜ EIN HAR</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">FLEUCH</span>.</li>

<li><i>EMS</i>, good. The <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">EMSIG</span>, is assiduous; <span class="smcap lowercase">DIE
EMSIGE BIENE</span>, the busy bee. It seems to come from
the <i>Old German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">EMMAZZIG</span>, for <span class="smcap lowercase">UNMUAZIG</span>, <i>occupatus
et minime otiosus</i>. After the same fashion is derived
the <i>French</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A-MUSER</span>.</li>

<li><i>ERFERKEN</i> (<span class="smcap lowercase">ERSECKEN</span>?), <span class="smcap lowercase">RETSCHEN</span>.</li>

<li><i>ERLAT</i>, the master. The <i>Welch</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">HERLOD</span>, is a stripling,
lad; <span class="smcap lowercase">HERLODES</span>, a damsel, girl. It is supposed
that the word “harlot,” which originally signified a
bold stripling, is from this. Chaucer says:—</li>

<li>
A sturdie <i>harlot</i>—that was her hostes man,<br />
He was a gentil <i>harlot</i>, and a kind.<br />
</li>

<li>If <span class="smcap lowercase">ERLAT</span> is from the <i>German</i>, it would be from <span class="smcap lowercase">HERRLAUT</span>,
a distinguished lord, a master.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">Pg 54</a></span></li>




<li><i>ERLATIN</i>, the mistress.</li>

<li><i>FELING</i>, a grocery, or general store; a grocer’s wife.</li>

<li><i>FETZEN</i>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">VETZEN</span>, to work, to make. <i>Latin</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">FACERE</span>.
The <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">FETZEN</span>, signifies a piece, or
slice.</li>

<li><i>FLADER</i>, a bath-room, a barber’s shop.</li>

<li><i>FLADER-FETZER</i>, a barber.</li>

<li><i>FLADER-FETZERIN</i>, a barber’s wife.</li>

<li><i>FLICK</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">KNAB</span>. <i>Hilpert</i> refers to <span class="smcap lowercase">FLÜGGE</span>, unfledged.</li>

<li><i>FLOSS</i>, soup. From the <i>German</i>, <i>FLOSS</i>, a stream;
<span class="smcap lowercase">FLOSSEN</span>, to flow.</li>

<li><i>FLOSSART</i>, water.</li>

<li><i>FLÖSSELT</i>, drowned. Previous to the time of Luther,
beggars were drowned when caught stealing. <i>Vide</i>
Gengenbach.</li>

<li><i>FLÖSSLEN</i>, to make water.</li>

<li><i>FLÖSSLING</i>, a fish. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">FLOSSE</span>, a fin.</li>

<li><i>FLUCKART</i>, poultry, birds. From the <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">FLIEGEN</span>,
to fly; literally, “fly-hard,” or “fast-flyer.”</li>

<li><i>FUNKART</i>, fire. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">FUNKE</span>, a spark.</li>

<li><i>FUNKARTHOLE</i>, an earthenware stove.</li>

<li><i>FÜNKELN</i>, to boil, cook, roast.</li>

<li><i>GACKENSCHERR</i>, a chicken. <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GACKERN</span>, to
cackle; <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHARREN</span>, to scratch.</li>

<li><i>GALCH</i>, a parson, priest. The <i>Old German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GALL</span>, is
<i>castratus</i>; the same with <span class="smcap lowercase">GELDE</span>,—whence <span class="smcap lowercase">GOL</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GEL</span>,
<span class="pagenum3"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">Pg 55</a></span>sterile. The <i>German</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">KELCH</span>, is a chalice, the communion
cup. <span class="smcap">Galch</span> may be, however, simply an
extension of <span class="smcap lowercase">GALLE</span>.</li>

<li><i>GALCHENBOSS</i>, a parsonage.</li>

<li><i>GALLE</i>, a parson. <i>Hebrew</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">KÁHAL</span>, a priest.</li>

<li><i>GATZAM</i>, a child. <i>Hebrew</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">GATAM</span>, said to be derived
from an <i>Arabic</i> word, signifying any one puny or

kitten.</li>

<li><i>GEBICKEN</i>, to catch.</li>
